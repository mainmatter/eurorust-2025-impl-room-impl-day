# EuroRust 2025 - `impl Room` & `impl Day`

The `impl Room` and `impl Day` are spaces at [EuroRust 2025](https://eurorust.eu/) for Rustaceans who want to contribute to the  Rust project or to other crates in the Rust ecosystem.  

If you're a maintainer, you can use these opportunities to mentor new contributors and help them get started with your project. If you're a contributor, you can get help with your first contribution or to find a project to contribute to.

## When

- The `impl Room` will be open during both days of the conference, on October 9th and 10th, from 11:00 to 17:30 CEST each.
- The `impl Day` will happen on the Saturday after the main conference, on October 11th, from 10:00 to 16:00 CEST.

When in doubt, refer to the [conference schedule](https://eurorust.eu/schedule/) for the most up-to-date information.

## Where

- The `impl Room` will be held in a dedicated room at the conference venue. You'll need a conference ticket to access the room.
- The `impl Day` will be hosted by Stockly in their offices in [8 Rue du Sentier, 75002 Paris](https://maps.app.goo.gl/gQrfzPksxjG8m323A). You do not need a conference ticket to access the `impl Day` but need to register for a free ticket on [eurorust.eu](https://eurorust.eu).

## Mentors: how to join 

If you have an idea for a project, [open an issue](https://github.com/mainmatter/eurorust-2025-impl-room/issues/new?assignees=&labels=project%2C+open&template=project-proposal.md&title=%5BProject+proposal%5D+%3CName+of+the+project%3E) 
with a short project description to find other folks who'd be interested to work on it with you.  

There is no definition of "the right project": the `impl Room` and `impl Day` are occasions to tinker and explore.

Do you need help to work on a PR that closes an issue on the compiler? That's a great project! Do you have a fuzzy picture in your mind for a crate that is missing in the ecosystem? Go ahead!

## Contributors: how to join 

Show up at the `impl Room` or `impl Day` with your laptop and your curiosity! Have a look at the projects that have been proposed by the mentors and join the one that you find interesting. You can even comment on the project issue beforehand to let the mentor know that you're interested.
